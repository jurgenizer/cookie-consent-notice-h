# cookie-consent-notice-a
### Cookie consent notice type a (binary, nudging)

Part of a typology of seven cookie consent notice types observed on popular South Africa websites in December 2021. This 'type a' cookie consent notice forms part of my Master of IS research. It will be compared to a [Design Science Research](http://www.desrist.org/desrist/content/design-science-research-in-information-systems.pdf) (DSR) artifact that aims to produce an improved cookie consent notice.

Code adapted from [GlowCookies](https://github.com/manucaralmo/GlowCookies) by Almoguera (2021).
Typology adapted from Utz et al. (2019), who evaluated the GUI of six types of cookie consent notices in a series of online experiments.

### Important:
This code is for UI testing only. Actual cookie setting/rejecting/deleting functionality is limited.
