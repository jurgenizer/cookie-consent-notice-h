### Cookie consent notice type h

This 'type h' cookie consent notice forms part of my Master of IS research project. (A [Design Science Research](http://www.desrist.org/desrist/content/design-science-research-in-information-systems.pdf) (DSR) project that aims to produce an improved cookie consent notice.) This artefact will be compared to a typology of seven cookie consent notice types observed on popular South Africa websites in December 2021.

Code adapted from [GlowCookies](https://github.com/manucaralmo/GlowCookies) by Almoguera (2021).
Typology adapted from Utz et al. (2019), who evaluated the GUI of six types of cookie consent notices in a series of online experiments.

### Important:
This code is for UI testing only. Actual cookie setting/rejecting/deleting functionality is limited.
